        I am from Brooklyn, New York. I am a twin and fun fact, my brother was born 2 years after my twin and I on the same day!! So all of us have the same birthday.
        I love love love music, dancing, perfume and anime. I also love to sing even though I don't have the voice for it. I work at Ivymount School in Rockville, MD teaching kids with autism. I aslo work partime at Arclight Bethesda movie theatre.
        There's never a dull moment at both of my jobs. I love my silly students, I am amazed at all the crazy things that happen at the theatre, and I love my co workers. My co-workers constantly make me life from: makign fun of my sneezes, that basically sounds like a velociraptor, according to my manager, laughing about how some of us can't pronouce words properly and are constantly talking in bad accents,
        and experiencing all the crazy and fun things that happen at the workpalce. Anyways, enough about me, I hope you enjoy my website.</p> -— Shanayah ❤</p>
